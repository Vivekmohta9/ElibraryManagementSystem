    A library management system is important to a library in the following ways:
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>1. It increases efficiency</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    A library management system (LMS or ILS, integrated library system) enhances the efficiency
    of the librarians and library users. A good library management system enables librarians
    to easily catalog books and keep proper records of books issued, reissued, and those not returned.
    On the other hand, library users can easily check the availability of any book that they need.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>2. It reduces the cost of managing a library</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    A library management system reduces the cost of management. The system eliminates the need to
    employ many workers and keep different manual files thereby reducing the cost. Additionally, one librarian can
    accomplish what more than what other several others can achieve at a given time.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>3. It saves time</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    Time is of the essence for both librarians and patrons. The librarian can easily record and go
    through the history of individual library users. On the other hand, the library users can know the location and
    availability of a particular book faster than before. Both the librarian and the student can accomplish more
    with less time.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>4. It increases the productivity of library workers</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    Automating your day to day processes will increase the productivity. An LMS ensures that the
    librarian spend their time doing what is important. Due to the growing ease of doing their work, librarians can
    engage in other important activities in the library without the library incurring any additional cost.
